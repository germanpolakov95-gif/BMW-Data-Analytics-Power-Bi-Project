# BMW-Data-Analytics-Power-Bi-Project
This repository presents a project for analyzing a .CSV file containing data on supported BMW models. Power BI was used for analysis and visualization.

This project analyzed the average price, median price, average mileage, median mileage, fuel types, and transmission types of various used BMW models depending on their age. The project also identified relationships between these parameters.

**To view**, you can download BMW Analysis.pbix and open it on your computer in Power Bi, or you can view screenshots of the project sheets in Screenshots.pdf (but in this case, dynamic charts will not be available).
