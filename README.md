# BMW-Data-Analytics-Power-Bi-Project
This repository presents a project for analyzing a .CSV file containing data on supported BMW models. Power BI was used for analysis and visualization.

To view, you can download BMW Analysis.pbix and open it on your computer in Power Bi, or you can view screenshots of the project sheets in Screenshots.pdf (but in this case, dynamic charts will not be available).
